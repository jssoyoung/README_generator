# README Generator

## Description

This project is a README generator. When the user opens this project on a command-line application, they will be asked a series of questions. The questions are mostly input based questions and includes one list type question. The inputs to these questions will then be taken and added into a README.md file. The template for the README file is already created and the user's answers will be inputted into the template. This project contains notes on index.js and the generateMarkdown.js file.

## Installation

The user will first be required to have a command-line application downloaded onto their computer or laptop. The user must also have node.js installed onto that device. Once they have these two downloaded, the user could type "npm i" into their terminal or window. Once this is finished being installed, the user type in "node index.js" to be asked the series of questions for this README generator. 

## Usage

Once the user has node.js installed into their computer or laptop, they could open their terminal or window and proceed to type into "node index.js" as mentioned above. The command-line application the user is using will the proceed to ask input questions. The user will be asked the name to their project, a short description about their project, steps needed to install their project, any collaborators on their project, tests for their project, their github username, and email. The user will also be asked one list question asking which license the project should have. Once the questions are all answered, a README.md file will be created with all of the information the user inputted into their command-line application. It will be inputted within the README template.
